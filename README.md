# NBody Simulation
This is a project taken from UC Berkley's CS61B Project 0 https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj0/proj0.

## To Run
compile using: 
```bash
javac Body.java NBody.java StdDraw.java
```
Run using:
```bash
java NBody <Total-time> <Time-step> <path-to-filename>
```
For example:
```bash
java NBody 157788000.0 25000.0 data/planets.txt
```

You should see a cool universe system with the planets moving around the sun for example:

You can also try out other cool simulations using the other text files in `data/` directory
```bash
java NBody 157788000.0 25000.0 data/atom.txt
```

## What I learned
I did this project to self learn Java and object oriented programming in Java.
